-- This file tests various race conditions when performing 'VACUUM FULL'.

-- 1. When the gpdb is performing 'VACUUM FULL' on some relation, it can be summarized
--    as the following 3 steps:
--    s1) create a new temporary relation (smgrcreate hook will be triggered, newly
--        created relfilenode will be put into shmem).
--    s2) insert data into the newly created relation from the old relation (smgrextend
--        hook will be triggered, newly created relfilenode will be put into shmem).
--    s3) change the old relation's relfilenode to the newly created one.
--    Consider the following situation:
--    If the diskquota bgworker pulls active oids before the 'VACUUM FULL' operation finishing,
--    the newly created relfilenode is translated to the newly created temporary relation's oid,
--    the old relation's size cannot be updated. We resolve it by making altered relations' oids
--    constantly active so that the diskquota bgworker keeps updating the altered relation size
--    during 'VACUUM FULL'.
